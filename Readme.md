# How to programmatically create a NavBarControl with groups and items


<p>This example demonstrates how the NavBarControl can be created and customized programmatically (in a code-behind file).</p><p>In this sample, two groups are created within the NavBarControl: the first group contains three items; the second group's content is represented by a StackPanel holding two TextBlock controls. The second TextBlock displays the text of the selected item within the NavBarControl.</p><p>The ItemSelecting event of the NavBarControl is handled to invoke a confirmation dialog allowing the selection of the first group's third item to be canceled.</p>
